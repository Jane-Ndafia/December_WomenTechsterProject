GRADED ASSIGNMENT Summary of Selected Web Development Resources
 
 
1. Complete Introduction to React (jscomplete.com)
 

 
This resource introduces React as a JavaScript library designed to build fast and interactive user interfaces. It explains that React applications are built using components, which are independent and reusable pieces of the interface. Each component controls its own logic and appearance, making applications easier to maintain and scale. The guide explains JSX as a syntax that allows developers to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript, which React then converts into elements. It also discusses how React uses a virtual representation of the DOM to efficiently update only the parts of the page that change. Key concepts such as props, state, event handling, and component reuse are clearly explained. The tutorial also introduces React Hooks as a modern way to manage state and behavior in functional components, providing a strong foundation for beginners learning React.
 
 
2. React Hooks Cheat Sheet (freeCodeCamp)
 

 
This article provides a clear explanation of the most commonly used React Hooks and how they simplify application development. It focuses on seven essential hooks that allow developers to manage state, handle side effects, and improve performance within functional components. The article explains useState for storing and updating data, useEffect for performing actions such as data fetching and DOM updates, and useRef for accessing elements directly without triggering re-renders. It also discusses useCallback and useMemo as tools for improving performance by avoiding unnecessary function recreation and repeated calculations. The useContext hook is presented as a way to share data across components without passing props repeatedly, while useReducer is described as a structured method for handling complex state logic. Overall, the article serves as a practical reference for writing clean and efficient React applications.
 
 
3. JavaScript HTML DOM Document (W3Schools)
 

 
This page explains the Document Object Model as the structured representation of an HTML document that JavaScript can access and manipulate. When a webpage loads, the browser converts the HTML into a tree-like structure that allows JavaScript to interact with the page content. Through the document object, developers can read, modify, add, or remove elements on a webpage. The resource explains how JavaScript can change text, attributes, styles, and respond to user events. Understanding the document object is presented as a core skill for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
 
 
4. JavaScript HTML DOM Elements (W3Schools)
 

 
This resource focuses on how JavaScript interacts with individual elements within a webpage. It explains different methods used to select elements, such as selecting by ID, class name, tag name, or CSS selectors. The page demonstrates how JavaScript can modify element content, update attributes, change styles, and respond to user actions. It also covers how new elements can be created and inserted into the page or removed when no longer needed. This knowledge enables developers to build responsive interfaces that update automatically based on user interaction or program logic.
